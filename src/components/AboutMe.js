            I truly enjoy building and creating new things. Whether itâ€™s
            building Lego creations with my children, drawing, painting, or
            anything else, I love the process of making something new. That
            enjoyment of creation is what led me to a career in graphic design
            and now to web development.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I am a Graphic Artist with a passion for creating designs
            that perform for my clients and over 15 years of substantial
            multi-industry design experience to back up that passion. I have
            designed nearly everything from newspaper ads to banners to car
            vinyls to web sites. My wealth of experience has given me a strong
            ability to produce designs that will not just look great on screen
            but will actually do great things for you and your business.
